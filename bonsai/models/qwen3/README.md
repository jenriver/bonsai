# ðŸŒ¸ Qwen 3 JAX NNX Model

This directory contains the JAX NNX implementation of the **Qwen 3** large language model, as part of the [JAX Bonsai](https://github.com/jenriver/jax-bonsai) project. Our goal is to provide a clear, well-documented, and easy-to-use version of this powerful model in JAX.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and start experimenting with the Qwen 3 model.

### 1. Generate from an example prompt.

Experiment with [Qwen3 generate example](qwen3_example.ipynb). Try giving a custom prompt and changing the model config.

### 2. Benchmark the model.
```bash
# To be added
```

### 3. Evaluate the model.

JAX-bonsai supports [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/interface.md). For sample quality evaluation, follow the steps below:

```python
