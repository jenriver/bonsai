# ðŸŒ¸ Gemma 3 JAX NNX Model

This directory contains the JAX NNX implementation of the **Gemma 3** large language model, as part of the [JAX Bonsai](https://github.com/jenriver/jax-bonsai) project. Our goal is to provide a clear, well-documented, and easy-to-use version of this powerful model in JAX.
